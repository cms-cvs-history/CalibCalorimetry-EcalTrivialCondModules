now all parameters used by the trivial cond retriever can be configured
by the user in the config file.
the default values currently provided are those used and needed by Giuseppe.
I wil soon promote all parameters to be tracked and require users to configure them explicitly
in their configuration file.
This will happen as soon as I provide a default config file for this module
